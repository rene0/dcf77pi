Version 3.7.0 --
* Replace verbose license texts in source files by SPDX identifiers.
* Makefile: always install LICENSE.md and fix uninstall target.
* Fix revival of issue #19.
* Do not use leapsecmonth to determine when a leap second announcement is
  valid, but count the number of valid 1 values of bit 19 in the preceding
  hour. If at least 50% of them are valid, the announcement is considered
  valid [closes issue #24].
* Anologous to the leap second announcement, use the number of valid 1 values
  of bit 16 instead of summermonth and wintermonth. [closes issue #24]
* Make fields dst\_announce and leap\_announce of DT\_result a boolean as
  invalid announcements are now impossible [closes issue #24].
* Do not insist on DST changes only being valid on the last Sunday of the
  month at 01:00 UTC in add\_minute() and substract\_minute() [closes issue #24]
* Remove leapsecmonth, summermonth and wintermonth from config.txt [closes
  issue #24]
* Replace config.txt by config.json, its equivalent in JSON. Update Makefile
  to compile/link various source files against json-c. set\_mode\_live() now
  takes a json\_object\* parameter that contains the parsed configuration.
  Remove now obsolete config.c and config.h [closes issue #11]
* Makefile: link testcentury only against calendar.o instead of libdcf77.so
* dcf77pi-analyze: no need to depend on the configuration file after removal
  of the month parameters.
* Only allow to set the system clock on the hour.
* Use new enumeration eSC\_status to report the result of setting the system
  clock instead of an integer, return this value via a new field in
  ML\_result instead of using get\_mainloop\_result()
* Rename show\_mainloop\_result() into process\_setclock\_result()
* Return move values from sysexists.h in set\_mode\_live()
* dcf77pi: increase the the of status bar messages to four seconds.
* Update README for #11 and #24

Version 3.6.1 -- 2017-11-19
* Makefile: drop splint target, does not work with Clang 4.0.0/FreeBSD 12
  nor with GCC 5.4.0/Ubuntu 16.04 [issue #6]
* Makefile: drop lint target, this is severely outdated [issue #6]
* make code compliant with ISO C99/POSIX.1-2008 [closes issue #17]
* do not stamp time as OK when the minute is exactly one bit too long [closes
  issue #18]
* display last bit of the minute in dcf77pi-analyze [closes issue #19]
* allow setting the system time on UTC hosts [closes issue #20]

* correctly handle bit buffer overflows [closes issue #26]
* fix parsing of log files when extra spaces are inserted [closes issue #25
  and #26]
* replace enumeration eGB\_skip by a boolean
* fix a bug where time could be all 0 if the previous minute was too long
* fix get\_isotime(): ISO days of year are 0-based, not 1-based
* also recover from too high values of bit 20
* dcf77pi: fix bug where the date parity but would only turn blue when the day
  of the month was wrong
* dcf77pi: improvements to statusbar timing and messages and "state" light
* update README.md on setting the system time

* README.md: add -r parameter of readpin
* add LICENSE.md [closes issue #5]
* add this change log [closes issue #14]
* default to "unknown third-party type" if the two third-party bits are unequal

  transmissions from 1973 and onward can also be decoded

  consisting of several finer-grained enumerations:
  * int, DT\_\* -> struct DT\_result, enum eDT\_\*
  * TPTYPE -> enum eTP
  * int, GETBIT\_\* -> struct GB\_result, enum eGB\_\*
  * BASEYEAR -> constant integer base\_year

    and i386
  * saves 1%-2% in binary sizes
  * requires less casts
  * no warnings from include-what-you-use 0.7 related to stdint.h

* synchronize radio code with that of readpin
* replace hardware.txt by config.txt, which uses key/value pairs instead of

  enough to prevent the received time from increasing too fast
* only announce DST changes or leap seconds if the received date and time are
  valid

  data is received
